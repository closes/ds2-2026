        "### 1. Introduction\n",
        "Project 7 requires you to analyse model output from the CMIP6 project. It is possible to access these data a number of ways, including via the cloud, since Google host a part of these data via their Public Datasets programme (https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/new-climate-model-data-now-google-public-datasets). For your project, this is how you will access the CMIP6 data. As you have seen in class, this method means that you will be able to analyse the data directly in Colab without downloading anything to your machine.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. What is ensemble modelling and why do we do it?\n",
        "CMIP6 uses an *ensemble modelling strategy*. What does this mean?\n",
        "\n",
        "In the context of CMIP6, an ensemble of model simulations is a collection of simulations that have been created using exactly the same configuration for everything, with the exception of the initial conditions. These small differences in the initial state can lead to much larger differences in the forecast over time, as popularised in the so-called \"butterfly effect\".\n",
        "\n",
        "We use ensemble modelling to help us understand the probability of the events simulated by the model occurring. For example, imagine that we use an ensemble of 5 simulations to try to forecast next week's weather, and all 5 simulations predict that it will rain in Brest. In this case, we will be more likely to believe that it will rain next week than if our results had been that 2 of our simulations told us that it would rain, 2 told us that it would be sunny and 1 told us that it would snow.\n",
        "\n",
        "The aim of the ensemble approach in climate modelling (as in CMIP6) is the same as in the weather forecasting case: it is an attempt to quantify how much we believe the predictions of the future climate.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. What is CMIP6?\n",
        "CMIP = Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupled_Model_Intercomparison_Project)\n",
        "\n",
        "The CMIP programme aims to improve our knowledge of climate change. It began in 1995, and has already been through 5 \"phases\". Each \"phase\" corresponds to a coordinated effort to collect together a number of climate simulations created by research centres around the world. These simulations are then made freely available for anybody to download and analyse. Phase 6 is now underway: the data that you will be analysing are thus only recently available, and are likely to be used in research studies for about the next ten years or so.\n",
        "\n",
        "A number of experiments are defined at each phase. These often consist of \"historical\" experiments, which simulate the climate over the past decade, and a number of future experiments, which simulate the future climate in response to certain prescribed greenhouse gas concentration scenarios, which should represent the response to possible future decisions made by society. (If you are interested in reading more about these, this article provides a nice introduction: https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-how-shared-socioeconomic-pathways-explore-future-climate-change)\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. What data are available for your projects?\n",
        "The CMIP6 catalogue contains a lot of data: the entire archive comprises about 20PB of outputs! Not all available data is stored in the Cloud, so you will need to check to see what is available when deciding which model(s) and scenario(s) you want to analyse.\n",

Arctic sea ice decrease has not been uniform over time: certain regions are losing ice much more quickly than others, and this is expected to continue into the future.\n",
        "\n",
        "Sea ice plays a very important role in the climate system for many reasons; one of the most important is that it acts as a very effective insulating \"lid\" on the ocean. The ocean is warm relative to the atmospheric temperature in the Arctic, and so if the sea ice disappears, this can lead to huge changes in the quantity of heat exchanged between the atmosphere and ocean. Depending on the location at which these changes in heat transfer occur, the impact on the atmosphere and its large-scale circulation can be very different, and so it is important to understand not only how much ice is being lost, but also where the ice is being lost. Your aim in this project will be to explore these spatial differences between different models, variables, and emission scenarios.\n",

        "Your main task in this project will be to apply clustering techniques to the time series of sea ice concentration, with the aim of identifying coherent regions of sea ice loss. You can also treat sea ice volume if you have time. You might compare the results obtained using multiple emissions scenarios to look at the consistency of the regional patterns.\n",

        "### Choosing the variables to use\n",
        "In the CMIP6 model outputs, you will find that a number of different variables relating to sea ice are available. The most widely available one is **\"sea-ice area percentage\"**: this is normally known as \"sea ice concentration\", and represents the percentage of each grid cell that is covered by sea ice.\n",
        "\n",
        "Sea ice is not a 2D quantity, it also has a height, and so to better understand the processes that act on sea ice, we also use **sea ice volume**. This is not normally supplied directly by models, but can be calculated by multipling **sea ice thickness * sea ice concentration * grid-cell area for ocean variables**. You will need to retrieve these 3 variables and calculate this quantity yourselves.\n",
        "\n",
        "Although other sea ice variables are produced by a number of models, the consistency of their availability across the different models and scenarios is not so good. Because of this, I recommend that you use only the sea ice concentration and sea ice volume variables to characterise the sea ice.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Time averaging\n",
        "**Seasonality**: it is possible that the patterns of sea ice loss will depend on the season, and so you should analyse each season separately. I recommend that you average the data as follows for each year:\n",
        "* winter = December, January, February\n",
        "* spring = March, April, May\n",

It also shows you how to resample the data to have a 5-year mean for each season: this 5-year averaging is not obligatory, but it might be helpful to make this average in order to keep the data size manageable.\n",
